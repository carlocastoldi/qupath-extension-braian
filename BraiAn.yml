# This is a configuration file for BraiAn, a extension helps managing multiple QuPath projects ensuring consistency.
# Typically, in whole-brain datasets, one brain = one QuPath project and BraiAn makes sure the exact same analysis parameters are
# consistently applied across different projects.
# It is meant to be placed either in a QuPath project folder, or in its parent directory.
# Ideally, the parent directory contains multiple QP projects for which the same parameteres are used in the analysis.
# If a value is not defined in the YAML, BraiAn will apply a default value.
